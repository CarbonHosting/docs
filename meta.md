```json
"title": "Toggled Starter"
```

If you want to apply a specific title for a single page: 

- Open the pages Markdown file.
- Go to the very top. (This is important nowhere else will work)
- And apply a title by using `"||YOUR TITLE HERE||"`

To apply a custom favicon for all pages, you can apply it like this to your toggled.json file:

```json

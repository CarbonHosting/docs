# Design Sites in Scratch

To start, you can just navigate to the scratch project you want to turn into a website and grab the project ID. It will look something like this `113321949`.

Next, go to www.toggled.tech/scratch/ and select "Create Site" or navigate to the Create tab of your dashboard and select "Scratch".

Finally, paste the project ID into the popup and press enter or send.

# Troubleshooting

If there is an error it is likely that the project you are trying to turn into a website is not published.

After publishing, it may take up to an hour before it can be turned into a website.

You can unpublish your project after you turn it into a website.

# Limitations

For simplicity, you cannot edit the build settings of your Scratch project before deploying it.

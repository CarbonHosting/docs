# Custom Carbon Elements

## Email Signup

Create a mailing list signup which will display on your dashboard.

```html
<carbonEmail data-name="<nickname>"></carbonEmail>
```

You can have multiple of these on each page.

Nickname will be displayed on your dashboard so you which forms are converting.

## Analytics

Use Google Analytics in your project.

```html
<googleAnalytics data-tag="<YOUR ANALYTICS ID>"></googleAnalytics>
```

Only one element per page is supported.

Keep in mind that Carbon will soon have built-in analytics.

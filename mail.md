# Complying with Legal Regulations

Once you start sending newsletters, it's important to comply with government regulations.

## FCC CAN-SPAM

The FCC requires you to have a method to unsubscribe a user from a mailng list, Toggled provides this for you. They also require that you include your address in the footer of the email. (Toggled does not monitor this, however you will be held responsible if damage occurs)

# Getting Started

Toggled Forms is an innovative new way to design the front-end for forms and then have your backend handle the requests easily.

Toggled Forms use the same principles as Toggled wesbites and documentation (MarkdownX).

## Template

To get started, fork this template: [https://github.com/toggledtech/Forms](https://github.com/toggledtech/Forms).

# Setup

Here are the basic steps to setup Toggled Forms.

## toggled-form.json

There are four things you must define in this.

- Schema
- Webhook
- Form (The file which your form is located in)
- Members (Required to verify your identity)

```json
{
  "schema": "https://toggled.tech/schema.json",
  "webhook": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
  "form": "YOUR_MDX_FILE",
  "members": ["YOUR_USERNAME"] 
}
```

## Setting up a webhook

In NodeJS, you can use Express.js to setup a webhook like this:

```js
app.post('/form-webhook', (req, res) => {
  //Do what you want with the data
  console.log(req.body)
})
```

If you do not have a server, setup a request bin.

## Designing the form

Here is a basic form template.

```html
<!-- Include Same Toggled Header -->

<!-- Each question (input) will be displayed separately. Only one question will be on the page at a time. -->

<Question data-type="string" data-placeholder="Enter a string" data-required="true" data-label="Enter a String" id="1"></Question>

<Question data-type="number" data-placeholder="Enter a number" data-required="true" data-label="Enter a Number" id="2"></Question>

<Question data-type="email" data-placeholder="Enter your email" data-required="true" data-label="Enter your Email" id="3"></Question>
```

## Deployment

Navigate to [https://toggled.tech/create/form/](https://toggled.tech/create/form/), select a GitHub repository and press create.

# Using your form

Once you have deployed it, you will automatically be given a URL that you can use permanently.

## Embed

To embed a form, use the Toggled web SDK.

```html
<script src="//toggled.tech/static/toggled.js"></script>

<div id="my-form"></div>

<script>
forms.init({
  container: '#my-form', //The query selector for your parent element
  form: 'YOUR_FORM_NAME' //{yourGitHubUsername}-{yourGithubProject} or the name that displays after site in the URL. /site/**toggledtech-Forms**/
})
</script>
```

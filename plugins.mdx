# Plugins

Toggled supports and develops many plugins for developers.

## Embeds

All of our embeds can be viewed in the [design section of custom elements](/site/toggledtech-docs/Custom%20Elements).

## Zymono

A Zymono plugin is currently in development. View more info here: [https://docs.zymono.com](https://docs.zymono.com).

## Fiber Styling

Fiber is an innovative new variant of CSS which allows for source attributes to be created. (This makes it easier so you can reuse elements more than once with just css.)

To compile a style element using Fiber, set the attribute `fiber` to `compile`

```html
<style fiber="compile">
 {Your Normal and Fiber Styles Here}
</style>
```

## GravityJS

The GravityJS static is automatically added to all Toggled Projects. You can use it by refering to the [GravityJS Documentation](https://github.com/useToggled/GravityJS).
